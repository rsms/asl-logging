# Logging with ASL -- Apple System Logger

`logging.h` and `logging.c` includes convenience functionality suitable for
most small-to-medium scale programs. Have a look at `usage.c` for a
minimalistic example or `example.c` for a more complete program.

You can build and test the `example.c` program by running make:

    make
    ./example --help
